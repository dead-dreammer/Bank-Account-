This C++ program simulates a simple banking system where a user enters their account number, account type (Savings or Checking), and current balance. It validates the account type input and then applies charges or interest based on the balance. For a savings account, if the balance is below $1000, a $10 fee is deducted; otherwise, a 4% interest is added. For a checking account, if the balance is below $1000, a $25 fee is deducted; if the balance is above $6000, a 3% interest is applied; otherwise, a 5% interest is added. Finally, the program displays the updated account details and notifies the user whether a fee was charged or interest was added.
